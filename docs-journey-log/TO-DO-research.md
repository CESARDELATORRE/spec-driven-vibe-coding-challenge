- Repo name for GH MCP server: CESARDELATORRE/spec-driven-vibe-coding-challenge

- Review ARCHITECTURE doc.

- ADD to JOURNAL LOG DAY 2:
    - Create initial feature specs docs (tbd)
        --> One PR per feature specs doc

- (*) Add global.research.prompt.md before creating the Architecture file and coding so I create research info.

For POC ARCHITECTURE:
- Raise any important high-level technical considerations, like platforms, languages, frameworks, and overall architecture details.

- (*) Add technology.research.prompt.md before creating the Architecture file and coding.
FEATURE:
- (*) feature.prompt.md for the specs creation for each FEATURE
- (*) plan.prompt.md for the implementation plan per each FEATURE

- (*) Add "measurement planning" ASAP, even before C# coding... at least the plan, initially.

- (*) What **metrics** to use for **decision making**.
-----------> CESAR: Specs docs should be validated when building the features and code, as a metric and measurement.

- HOW TO create and test assumptions or hypothesis?

- Do iterations as GH VERSIONS? --> iterations

- Add Coding-Rules.md file before generating code.

- Update the "ARCHITECTURE DOC FILE NAME when created into the copilot-instructions.md:
<key must-follow items>
        - Use the exact build/test commands from AGENTS.md "Build & Test".
        - (*********) Obey architecture constraints in the Architecture document within /docs folder.
        - PRs: respect "PR Rules" (conventional commits, CI gates).
        - Never commit secrets; see "Security".
</key>

- ## Build & Test instructions at the AGENTS.MD file for Agents to take into account.



- Include the .vscode/tasks.json file when creating TESTS.

- Evaluate the creationg of a "decision log template" as suggested by GHCP.
