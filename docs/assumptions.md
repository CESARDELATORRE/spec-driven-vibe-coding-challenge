# Assumptions: Customer feedback and hypothesis validation

Since this is an exercise and we don't have real users to interview, we assume that:
- Negative feedback about the current generic chat-bot for AMG already exists from customers
- Current customer pain-points with the generic approach have been documented
- The main hypothesis has been validated through customer research
- Market demand exists for domain-specific conversational agents


# Assumptions: Business context

We assume that:
- Azure Managed Grafana has sufficient market presence to justify dedicated agent development
- Organizational resources exist to support this type of specialized agent development
- The prototype-to-production pathway is technically and commercially viable


# Assumptions: Chat Agent component

We assume that:
- Users will primarily ask questions in English for the prototype/POC scope
- Knowledge base contains sufficient AMG-specific content for meaningful responses
- Azure AI Foundry service provides adequate LLM capabilities for domain-specific conversations
- Users expect conversational response times under 10 seconds
- Single query-response interaction is sufficient for prototype validation
- Manual testing is sufficient for prototype validation (automated testing deferred to future versions)
- Basic conversation context within single session is sufficient for prototype scope
- Simple error handling and fallback responses are adequate for demonstration purposes
- Professional, helpful tone consistent with Azure documentation is appropriate for all user types
- Target response length of 50-200 words meets user expectations for conciseness and helpfulness
