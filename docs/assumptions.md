# Assumption: Problem to be solved and customer feedback on the current generic chat-bot for AMG

- Since this is an exercise and we don't have real users to ask about the "problem to be solved", feedback about the current chat-bot and the reasons why we want to do this project/idea, we assume that we already have that negative feedback and current customer's pain-points about the generic chat-bot for AMG and therefore we created the following hypothesis based on that.


# Assumption: Hypothesis validation

Again, since this is an exercise, we assume that the main hypothesis was validated by hypothetical customers/users.
