# Assumptions: Customer feedback and hypothesis validation

Since this is an exercise and we don't have real users to interview, we assume that:
- Negative feedback about the current generic chat-bot for AMG already exists from customers
- Current customer pain-points with the generic approach have been documented
- The main hypothesis has been validated through customer research
- Market demand exists for domain-specific conversational agents


# Assumptions: Business context

We assume that:
- Azure Managed Grafana has sufficient market presence to justify dedicated agent development
- Organizational resources exist to support this type of specialized agent development
- The prototype-to-production pathway is technically and commercially viable
