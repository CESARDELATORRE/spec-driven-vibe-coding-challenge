# Vibe definition and coding exercise

## Overview and context

This vibe‑coding exercise is designed to showcase **how to operate as a product maker**, not a product consumer. Therefore, it's about **taking an ambiguous idea from hypothesis → prototype**. 

It is up to us to shape this idea toward product/market fit. 

It's important to **demonstrate how we articulate the problem and user segments**, **define success metrics**, **create and test assumptions**, and **iterate quickly based on evidence**. 

It's important to **capture and explain the tradeoffs** we make along the way. 

The main goal is to **demonstrate end‑to‑end PM + developer craft**: *problem framing, discovery, scoping, iterative prototyping, measurement planning, and clear storytelling* about why this  solution is the right next step, **not just that it “works.”**.

## The specific challenge

**Hypothesis:** The current [Azure Managed Grafana (AMG) marketing web site](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/managed-grafana), a.k.a. front door has a generic agent/chat bot. 

The initial **hypothesis** is that customers and users would be better served by a dedicated agent specifically for AMG.

The exercise's goal is to build a dedicated AI agent for the Azure Managed Grafana (AMG) marketing web site (a prototype or POC), to potencially replace the generic Azure agent and better serve customers and users. 

We can use any tools you prefer such as GH Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc. but it's important to save all the used prompts and artifacts to be able to showcase the reasoning process.

In addition to having the prompts as part of the reasoning process, we should have a clickable prototype/POC along with its iterations, and any **metrics used** for **decision making**. 

We should include a concise rationale of the hypothesis and prototype and how it achieves the goal of “better serving” the customers and users for AMG marketing page.
