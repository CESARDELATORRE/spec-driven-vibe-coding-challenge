# Temporal Technical Scope (Extracted from Earlier Idea & Vision Draft)

Purpose: Parking lot for technical / architectural implementation details intentionally removed from `idea-vision-scope.md` to keep that document high-level and product/vision focused. This file is TEMPORARY and may be merged into `architecture-technologies.md` or discarded once integrated.

## 1. Prototype Implementation Note (Original Detail)
Status at time of extraction (September 2025):
- ✅ KB MCP Server with text file knowledge base
- ✅ Orchestrator Agent with in-process Chat Agent
- ✅ Basic AMG knowledge content for demonstrations
- ⏳ Production-ready AMG content (placeholder subset only)
- ⏳ Multi-variant architecture (only Variant 1 implemented)

## 2. Functional / Technical Capability Breakdown (Original Granular Form)
The prototype was described as supporting:
- Natural language query processing about Azure Managed Grafana (AMG)
- Generation of contextually appropriate responses grounded in domain knowledge
- Handling of follow-up questions within a conversation session (NOTE: deferred in revised scope to single-turn; multi-turn considered future)
- Configurable knowledge base integration (initially file-based)
- Knowledge base updates without full system reconfiguration
- Standardized integration via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Multi-chat environment interoperability (e.g., GitHub Copilot, others)

## 3. Architecture Evolution Variants (Originally Inlined)
Planned variants (details to be formalized in `architecture-technologies.md`):
1. Variant 1: Prototype / POC (Local Desktop) – local execution, STDIO transport, file-backed KB.
2. Variant 2: Dockerized Decoupled (Local) – containerized deployment, HTTP+SSE (or similar) transport, process separation.
3. Variant 3: Cloud-Native (Managed ACA or AKS) – single cloud deployment path (platform decision deferred) with secrets, observability, and baseline scaling.
	(Potential Future Enterprise Expansion: Multi-region, compliance automation, advanced resilience – intentionally not numbered now.)

## 4. Prototype Phased Implementation (Original Step List)
Original four-phase implementation list:
1. Implement MCP server surfacing a basic knowledge base example.
2. Set up basic agent consuming the KB MCP server for answering.
3. Test conversations via selected MCP-compatible clients (GitHub Copilot, M365 Copilot, Claude, etc.).
4. Document results and demonstrate functionality.

## 5. Deferred / Out-of-Scope Technical Features (Original Wording)
Deferred (to future horizons):
- Multi-turn conversational memory persistence.
- Comprehensive AMG documentation ingestion pipeline.
- Increased performance or scaling topology design.
- Advanced telemetry / analytics / monitoring instrumentation.
- Multi-channel UX surfaces (web embed, mobile, voice).

Explicitly Out-of-Scope for Prototype:
- Human escalation or routing workflows.
- Compliance-grade security posture.
- Automated content freshness / sync pipelines.
- Autonomous multi-agent planning / multi-step reasoning loops.

## 6. Original Production Readiness Matrix (Technical Emphasis)
| Aspect | Prototype Status (Then) | Production Requirement (Forward View) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Architecture | Modular design proven | Horizontal scaling & resilience patterns |
| Performance | Single-user adequate | Load balancing, perf baselines, SLIs/SLOs |
| Security | Basic secret handling only | Managed secret store (e.g., Key Vault) |
| Monitoring | Console / stderr logging only | APM, metrics, distributed tracing |
| Content | Placeholder subset | Full authoritative domain coverage |
| Testing | Basic unit + light integration | Full regression + automated evaluation harness |
| Operations | Manual execution | CI/CD pipeline, environment promotion workflow |

## 7. Risks (Technical Emphasis Extract)
| Risk | Category | Impact | Mitigation (Future) |
|------|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Limited KB depth | Product/Quality | Weak value perception | Expand ingestion + relevance tagging |
| LLM hallucination | Quality | Erodes trust | Add retrieval grounding + eval harness |
| Early over-abstraction | Execution | Slows iteration | Enforce Constitution simplicity principle |
| Scale misalignment | Architecture | Rework at later horizons | Time-box variant upgrades & codify triggers |

## 8. Knowledge Base Strategy (Implicit in Original Text)
Initial: flat curated text files for controllable, inspectable domain grounding.
Future Path (to be detailed elsewhere): progressive extraction → structured sources → automated ingestion pipelines → freshness / drift detection.

## 9. Interoperability Notes (Original Intent)
- MCP chosen to enable multi-tool / multi-client attachment without bespoke adapters.
- STDIO transport acceptable for prototype speed; HTTP/SSE reserved for later containerized/cloud variants.

## 10. Extensibility Considerations (Captured but Moved Out)
- Domain portability requires isolating domain-specific content from orchestration logic.
- Additional domain onboarding should NOT require refactoring orchestration core (target for H2 readiness checklist).

## 11. Evaluation Guidance (Implied)
- Manual curated prompt set for qualitative scoring (relevance, clarity, domain grounding).
- Future: automated evaluation harness with prompt templates + golden set responses.

## 12. Next Actions for Migration
This file's content should be:
1. Reviewed while drafting or refining `architecture-technologies.md`.
2. Merged selectively—discard redundant or superseded details.
3. Deleted once its content is fully integrated (log deletion in `tradeoffs.md` if any rationale shifts).
