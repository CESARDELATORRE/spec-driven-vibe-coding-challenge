# Idea and Vision Scope: Dedicated agentic system specific for AMG

## Executive Summary

This project develops a domain-specific AI agent for AMG marketing page that demonstrates how to move from hypothesis to prototype in an evidence-driven manner. Starting with Azure Managed Grafana (AMG) as the initial domain, the solution creates a specialized conversational agent that provides precise, domain-specific insights compared to generic chatbots. The system is designed with a modular, reusable architecture that can be adapted for other technical product domains, aiming for a scalable solution for organizations seeking to enhance their customer engagement through specialized AI agents, as part of the vision.

## Context: Customers and old solution situation

### Current chat bot functionality summary
The current Azure Managed Grafana marketing website utilizes a generic Azure agent/chatbot that serves multiple Azure services. This generic approach provides broad but shallow coverage across the entire Azure ecosystem, lacking the depth and specialization needed for specific service domains like AMG.

### Problem to be solved (feedback and pain points)
Based on hypothetical customer feedback (exercise assumption - see assumptions.md), users experience the following pain points with the current generic chatbot:
- **Limited domain expertise**: Generic responses lack specialized AMG knowledge
- **Shallow knowledge depth**: Cannot provide detailed technical insights about AMG features and use cases
- **Poor extensibility**: Current system cannot grow with additional domain-specific knowledge

**Note**: Since this is an exercise and we don't have real users to ask about the problem to be solved, we assume that we already have negative feedback and current customer pain-points about the generic chat-bot for AMG.

### Main hypothesis
Customers and users will be better served by a dedicated agent specifically designed for Azure Managed Grafana, rather than relying on a generic Azure agent that covers all services superficially.

### Hypothesis validation/invalidation
For this exercise, we assume the hypothesis has been validated through hypothetical customer feedback and user research, indicating strong demand for domain-specific conversational agents that provide deeper, more relevant insights. (See assumptions.md for details on exercise constraints.)

## Product Overview

### Core value proposition:
Instantly generate precise, domain-specific insights about Azure Managed Grafana through natural language conversations, providing users with expert-level guidance that generic chatbots cannot deliver.

### Why this solution is the right next step
1. **Specialized expertise**: Addresses the gap between generic AI assistance and deep domain knowledge
2. **Reusable framework**: Creates a template for developing similar agents across other technical domains
3. **Evidence-driven approach**: Demonstrates proper product development methodology from hypothesis to prototype

### Target audience:
- **Primary**: DevOps Engineers and Technical Architects evaluating monitoring and observability solutions
- **Secondary**: IT Decision Makers comparing Azure services for organizational needs
- **Tertiary**: Developers implementing monitoring dashboards and seeking technical guidance

### Key differentiators:
- **Domain specialization**: Deep, expert-level knowledge in specific technical domains
- **Architectural flexibility**: Modular design enabling rapid adaptation to new domains
- **Rapid deployment**: The "easy to switch to other domains" approach enables quick time-to-market for new domain agents

## Functional Requirements

### Core Capabilities
1. **Natural Language Processing**: Process user queries in natural language and understand AMG-related context
2. **Domain-Specific Responses**: Generate accurate, relevant responses based on AMG knowledge base
3. **Knowledge Base Integration**: Interface with configurable knowledge sources through MCP protocol
4. **Multi-Platform Integration**: Support integration with various chat environments (GitHub Copilot, etc.)
5. **Response Quality**: Ensure responses are accurate, helpful, and appropriately scoped to AMG domain

### Technical Implementation
- Process natural language queries about Azure Managed Grafana
- Generate contextually appropriate responses based on domain knowledge
- Handle follow-up questions within conversation sessions
- Interface with configurable knowledge base systems
- Support knowledge base updates without system reconfiguration
- Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized integration
- Support deployment across multiple chat environments

## Vision and Scope

### Long-term Vision
**Horizon 1 (Prototype/POC)**: Demonstrate working AMG-specific agent with basic conversational capabilities and simple knowledge base integration.

**Horizon 2 (MVP to Production)**: 
- Expand to multiple Azure service domains
- Implement advanced conversation context management
- Add comprehensive monitoring and analytics
- Integrate with Azure support and sales systems

**Horizon 3 (Platform Vision)**:
- Multi-channel integration across web, mobile, and voice interfaces
- Advanced escalation pathways to human support
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance features
- AI-powered knowledge base curation and updates

### Prototype/POC Scope

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Simplicity**: Single agent, single domain (AMG), basic knowledge base
- **Demonstrability**: Clear, working conversational interface
- **Rapid Development**: Achievable within exercise timeframe

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Phase 1**: Implement MCP server for surfacing a basic knowledge base example
2. **Phase 2**: Set up basic agent consuming the previous content MCP server for answering
3. **Phase 3**: Test conversations from selected MCP-compatible UIs/chats such as GH CoPilot, M365 CoPilot or Claude
4. **Phase 4**: Document results and demonstrate functionality

**Growth Path (POC to MVP):**
- **Knowledge Base Expansion**: Migration from text files to comprehensive documentation sources
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Extension to additional Azure services
- **Enhanced Conversation**: Advanced context management and session persistence
- **Quality Metrics**: Implementation of comprehensive testing and validation frameworks

**Out of Scope for Prototype:**
- Multi-channel integration (web, mobile, voice interfaces)
- Advanced conversation context management across sessions
- Escalation pathways to human support or sales teams
- Enterprise security features for sensitive data handling
- Advanced monitoring and analytics capabilities
- Production-grade deployment infrastructure

**Prototype Tradeoffs:**
- **Integration Environment**: GitHub Copilot or similar instead of actual Azure marketing page integration (see tradeoffs.md)
- **Knowledge Base**: Simple text file/sample content instead of comprehensive documentation integration (see tradeoffs.md)
- **Content Scope**: Sample content from marketing and documentation rather than complete knowledge base
- **Testing Environment**: Simulated rather than real customer interaction scenarios
- **Domain Flexibility**: Designed for easy switching between domains to demonstrate architectural flexibility

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Knowledge Base Quality**: Limited prototype content may not adequately demonstrate value proposition
- **LLM Response Accuracy**: AI model may generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses without proper tuning
- **Scalability Concerns**: Prototype architecture may not translate effectively to production requirements

### Business Risks
- **Market Validation**: Actual customer demand may differ from hypothetical feedback
- **Competitive Response**: Existing solutions may evolve to address similar needs
- **Technology Evolution**: Rapid changes in AI/LLM landscape may impact solution relevance
- **Resource Requirements**: Production implementation may require significantly more resources than anticipated
