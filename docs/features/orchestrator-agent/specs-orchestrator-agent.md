## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a domain expert evaluating Azure Managed Grafana (AMG), I want to ask specific questions about AMG capabilities and receive accurate, domain-grounded answers so that I can make informed decisions without navigating through generic documentation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a specific question about AMG features, **When** I ask "What are the key security features of Azure Managed Grafana?", **Then** I receive a concise answer that includes specific AMG security capabilities based on domain knowledge
2. **Given** I need to check if the system is working, **When** I request the orchestrator status, **Then** I receive current health information about the orchestrator and its connected services
3. **Given** I ask a question that requires domain knowledge, **When** the knowledge base is available, **Then** my answer is grounded in AMG-specific content rather than generic responses
4. **Given** I ask a question when the knowledge base is unavailable, **When** the system processes my request, **Then** I receive a response indicating the knowledge base wasn't used and get a disclaimer about the response quality
5. **Given** I submit an empty question, **When** the system validates the input, **Then** I receive a clear validation error message stating "Question is required"
6. **Given** I ask a valid AMG question, **When** the system processes it successfully, **Then** I receive a structured response containing the answer, knowledge base usage indicator, and source information
7. **Given** the knowledge base returns very large content, **When** the system processes the response, **Then** the content is automatically truncated with a clear indication of truncation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I ask an empty or very short question?
- How does the system handle knowledge base connection failures?
- What occurs when I ask questions outside the AMG domain scope?
- How does the system respond to very long or complex questions?
- What happens when knowledge base returns oversized content?
- How does the system handle downstream LLM service failures?
- What occurs when multiple concurrent requests are made?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept natural language questions about Azure Managed Grafana domain
- **FR-002**: System MUST coordinate between knowledge base lookup and response generation
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide status information about orchestrator health and connected services
- **FR-004**: System MUST return responses within 10 seconds for typical domain questions
- **FR-005**: System MUST indicate when responses are grounded in knowledge base content versus general knowledge
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate input questions and reject empty or invalid requests with clear error messages
- **FR-007**: System MUST continue operating when knowledge base is unavailable, providing appropriate disclaimers
- **FR-008**: System MUST limit knowledge base results to prevent overwhelming response generation
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide concise responses (target 50-200 words) suitable for decision-making
- **FR-010**: System MUST log all interactions for debugging and monitoring purposes
- **FR-011**: System MUST use the simplest protocol approach suitable for local execution and testing with MCP clients such as GitHub Copilot or Claude
- **FR-012**: System MUST expose both primary tools (ask_domain_question and get_orchestrator_status) in MCP tool discovery
- **FR-013**: System MUST automatically decide when knowledge base lookup is needed without requiring user configuration
- **FR-014**: System MUST truncate oversized knowledge base content and indicate truncation to prevent system overload
- **FR-015**: System MUST return structured responses containing answer, usage indicators, and source information
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle downstream service errors gracefully without system failure
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide real-time status information without triggering external service calls
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain stateless operation with no persistence between user interactions

### Key Entities
- **Domain Question**: Natural language query about AMG capabilities, features, or configuration
- **Domain Response**: Synthesized answer combining knowledge base content and conversational generation
- **Orchestrator Status**: Health and connectivity information for the orchestrator and its dependencies
- **Knowledge Snippet**: Relevant domain content retrieved to ground the response
