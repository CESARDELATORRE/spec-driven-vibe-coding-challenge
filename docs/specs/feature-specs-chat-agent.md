# Feature Specification: Chat Agent

## Overview

The Chat Agent is a core component that provides conversational AI capabilities for the Azure Managed Grafana (AMG) domain-specific agent system. It processes user queries and generates intelligent responses by leveraging Azure AI Foundry LLM services and coordinating with knowledge base sources through the orchestration layer.

## User Journey

### Primary User Flow (Prototype/POC)
1. **User submits query**: User asks a question about Azure Managed Grafana through a supported chat interface
2. **Agent processes request**: Chat Agent receives the query through the orchestration layer
3. **Knowledge retrieval**: Agent coordinates with KB MCP Server (via orchestrator) to access relevant AMG information
4. **Response generation**: Agent generates contextually appropriate response using LLM capabilities
5. **User receives answer**: User gets precise, AMG-specific information to help with their needs

### Example Interaction
```
User: "What are the key benefits of Azure Managed Grafana for monitoring?"
Agent: "Azure Managed Grafana offers several key benefits for monitoring: 
       - Fully managed service reducing operational overhead
       - Native integration with Azure Monitor and other Azure services
       - Enterprise-grade security and compliance features
       - Scalable dashboard and alerting capabilities
       Would you like me to explain any of these benefits in more detail?"
```

## Functional Requirements

### Prototype/POC Scope

**Implementation Note**: For the initial prototype/POC, the Chat Agent may be implemented in-process within the Orchestrator Agent using Semantic Kernel's ChatCompletionAgent to simplify the architecture and reduce complexity. This approach avoids the need for a separate MCP server and inter-process communication during the prototype phase.
