# Tradeoff 1: No real integration with Azure Managed Grafana (AMG) marketing web site pages

The AI agent for the Azure Managed Grafana (AMG) marketing web site would be a prototype, but since you don't have the rights/possibility to integrate my agent-chat-bot into Azure's UI, logically, therefore the testing execution environment can be "any", for instance, testing/consuming it from GitHub CoPilot or any other Chat UI that I can use like by using MCP.



# Tradeoff 2: Content/KB to support the chat capabilities can be "any", for simulation. 
 
The prototype should provide a mechanism for the chat to be aware about content/KB related to the domain (in this case Azure Managed Grafana (AMG).
But since this is an exercise, the confirmed assumption is that we can use any example content to hypothetically support the chat capabilities.

In a real feature/product, that content would be provided for real. In this prototype we can simply use a "sampling" approach, as tradeoff.

It's interesting, however, that the approach taken for the KB/content should proably be based on an interface/tool that in the future could be improved with more content without impacting the function of the prototype.

Even further, make the prototype generic so today it can target content from Azure Managed Grafana (AMG) but tomorrow it can handle content for a different domain.
