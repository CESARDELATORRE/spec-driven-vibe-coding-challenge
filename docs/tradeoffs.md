# Tradeoff 1: Integration environment - GitHub Copilot vs. Azure marketing website

**Decision**: Use GitHub Copilot or other MCP-compatible chat interfaces for testing instead of integrating directly with Azure Managed Grafana marketing website.

**Reason**: We don't have access rights to modify Azure's production marketing website.

**Impact**: Testing will demonstrate functionality but not the exact production user experience.

# Tradeoff 2: Knowledge base complexity - Sample content vs. comprehensive documentation

**Decision**: Use simplified sample content instead of full Azure Managed Grafana documentation.

**Reason**: Exercise timeframe and focus on demonstrating architectural approach rather than content completeness.

**Impact**: Prototype will show concept viability but may not reflect full production knowledge depth.

# Tradeoff 3: Domain specificity vs. architectural flexibility

**Decision**: Design for easy domain switching rather than hyper-optimization for AMG only.

**Reason**: Demonstrate broader platform potential and reusability across Azure services.

**Impact**: May sacrifice some AMG-specific optimizations in favor of architectural generalization.

# Tradeoff 4: Response accuracy vs. development speed

**Decision**: Use out-of-the-box LLM capabilities with basic prompt engineering rather than fine-tuning.

**Reason**: Rapid prototyping timeline and demonstration focus over production-grade accuracy.

**Impact**: Responses may be less precise than a production system but sufficient for concept validation.

# Tradeoff 5: Scalability vs. simplicity

**Decision**: Implement simple, single-server architecture instead of distributed, production-ready infrastructure.

**Reason**: Prototype focus and exercise constraints.

**Impact**: Demonstrates core functionality but doesn't address production scalability requirements.

# Tradeoff 6: KB MCP Server content updates - Static vs. dynamic file monitoring

**Decision**: Use static text file with local access from the MCP server process for prototype/POC.

**Reason**: Simplifies implementation and reduces complexity for demonstration purposes.

**Impact**: Knowledge base content cannot be updated during runtime; server restart required for content changes.

# Tradeoff 7: KB MCP Server performance - Small content vs. scalable architecture

**Decision**: Assume small prototype content files to avoid performance optimization complexity.

**Reason**: Focus on core functionality demonstration rather than production-scale performance.

**Impact**: May not reflect production performance characteristics but sufficient for concept validation.

# Tradeoff 8: KB MCP Server logging - Basic vs. comprehensive monitoring

**Decision**: Include very basic logging for debugging and monitoring requests only.

**Reason**: Rapid prototyping timeline and demonstration focus over production-grade observability.

**Impact**: Limited debugging capabilities but sufficient for prototype validation and troubleshooting.

# Tradeoff 9: KB MCP Server content formatting - Raw text vs. normalized processing

**Decision**: Use easiest implementation approach without text normalization unless required for functional chat responses.

**Reason**: Minimize implementation complexity while maintaining core functionality.

**Impact**: May result in less polished content presentation but preserves original formatting and reduces processing overhead.

# Tradeoff 10: KB MCP Server search scope - Exact vs. flexible matching

**Decision**: Implement case-insensitive search with partial matches for prototype/POC.

**Reason**: Provides better user experience without requiring complex search algorithms or indexing.

**Impact**: More forgiving search behavior that improves prototype usability while keeping implementation simple.

# Tradeoff 11: KB MCP Server content structure - Structured vs. unstructured text

**Decision**: Don't assume any concrete structure in the text file; treat as plain text without sections or headers.

**Reason**: Simplifies implementation and works with any text content without requiring specific formatting.

**Impact**: Cannot provide section-based navigation but enables use of any plain text knowledge base content.

# Tradeoff 12: KB MCP Server error handling - Detailed vs. basic error reporting

**Decision**: Implement very basic error detail in favor of code readability for prototype/POC.

**Reason**: Reduces implementation complexity while providing sufficient debugging information for demonstration.

**Impact**: Limited error diagnostics but cleaner, more maintainable code suitable for prototype validation.

# Tradeoff 13: KB MCP Server response limits - Unlimited vs. bounded responses

**Decision**: Limit content returned in single response to prevent overwhelming the Chat Agent.

**Reason**: Ensures manageable response sizes and prevents context window issues in downstream agents.

**Impact**: May require multiple queries for comprehensive information but improves system reliability and performance.

# Tradeoff 14: Search vs. Full Content Exposure

**Decision**: Removed the prototype `search_knowledge` excerpt tool and associated search DTOs in favor of a single `get_kb_content` tool returning full raw text.

**Reason**: Prototype scope prioritized simplicity and reduced round-trips; excerpt logic added maintenance overhead without delivering materially different value for a small text corpus.

**Impact**: Codebase is smaller (fewer models, tests, and tool wiring). Future reintroduction of search/semantic retrieval can start clean with an embedding-based design rather than repurposed excerpt semantics.
