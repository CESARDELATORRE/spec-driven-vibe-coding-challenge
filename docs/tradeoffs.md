# Tradeoff 1: Integration environment - GitHub Copilot vs. Azure marketing website

**Decision**: Use GitHub Copilot or other MCP-compatible chat interfaces for testing instead of integrating directly with Azure Managed Grafana marketing website.

**Reason**: We don't have access rights to modify Azure's production marketing website.

**Impact**: Testing will demonstrate functionality but not the exact production user experience.

# Tradeoff 2: Knowledge base complexity - Sample content vs. comprehensive documentation

**Decision**: Use simplified sample content instead of full Azure Managed Grafana documentation.

**Reason**: Exercise timeframe and focus on demonstrating architectural approach rather than content completeness.

**Impact**: Prototype will show concept viability but may not reflect full production knowledge depth.

# Tradeoff 3: Domain specificity vs. architectural flexibility

**Decision**: Design for easy domain switching rather than hyper-optimization for AMG only.

**Reason**: Demonstrate broader platform potential and reusability across Azure services.

**Impact**: May sacrifice some AMG-specific optimizations in favor of architectural generalization.

# Tradeoff 4: Response accuracy vs. development speed

**Decision**: Use out-of-the-box LLM capabilities with basic prompt engineering rather than fine-tuning.

**Reason**: Rapid prototyping timeline and demonstration focus over production-grade accuracy.

**Impact**: Responses may be less precise than a production system but sufficient for concept validation.

# Tradeoff 5: Scalability vs. simplicity

**Decision**: Implement simple, single-server architecture instead of distributed, production-ready infrastructure.

**Reason**: Prototype focus and exercise constraints.

**Impact**: Demonstrates core functionality but doesn't address production scalability requirements.
