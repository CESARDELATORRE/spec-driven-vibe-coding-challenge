# Idea & Vision Scope: Dedicated Agentic System for Azure Managed Grafana (AMG)

This document defines the product vision, problem framing, phased evolution (horizons), and prototype scope for the dedicated AMG domain agent. It intentionally avoids deep technical / architectural detail (those belong in `architecture-technologies.md`). It aligns with the Constitution (Spec‑Driven, Simplicity, Traceability) and complements:
- Original challenge definition (`01-original-challenge-definition.md`)
- Goals & approaches (`02-plain-goals-and-approaches.md`)
- Assumptions (`assumptions.md`)
- Tradeoffs log (`tradeoffs.md`)

## 1. Executive Summary
We are building a domain‑specific conversational agent for Azure Managed Grafana (AMG) to replace or augment a generic, multi-service chatbot that lacks depth. The initiative demonstrates moving from hypothesis → validated prototype while establishing a reusable pattern for future domain agents. The prototype focuses on correctness, clarity, and domain value—not scale or production hardening.

## 2. Problem & Hypothesis
Current generic chat-based assistance (assumed per exercise constraints) fails to deliver depth for AMG evaluators and practitioners. Hypothesis: A dedicated AMG agent providing precise, contextual, domain-grounded responses yields higher perceived usefulness and trust than a general-purpose Azure chatbot.

## 3. Vision Statement
Deliver a family of domain-specialized AI agents that:
1. Provide authoritative, scoped answers grounded in curated domain knowledge.
2. Are fast to instantiate for a new domain (low switching cost, high reuse of scaffolding).
3. Evolve safely from local prototype → multi-domain platform without architectural churn.

## 4. Strategic Outcomes (Why This Matters)
- Reduce cognitive load for users evaluating AMG by surfacing concise, relevant answers.
- Demonstrate a replicable pattern for other Azure (or non-Azure) product domains.
- Establish disciplined, spec-driven product engineering practices (artifact lineage, traceability, test focus).

## 5. Target Users (Proto-Personas)
- DevOps / SRE Engineer evaluating managed visualization/observability options.
- Technical Architect assessing integration fit & operational characteristics.
- IT Decision Maker comparing managed service offerings.
- (Future) Customer Success / Support augmentation scenarios.

## 6. Differentiators
- Domain depth over breadth (precision > coverage).
- Documentation/decision traceability from day 1 (Constitution compliance).
- Explicit evolutionary path (horizons) reducing rework risk.
- Reusable knowledge ingestion + orchestration pattern.

## 7. Horizons & Evolution Roadmap
High-level phases (technology details deferred to architecture document):

| Horizon | Goal Focus | Representative Milestones | Exit Signal |
|---------|------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| H1 Prototype (Current) | Prove domain value & basic agent workflow | Dedicated AMG agent, basic KB, single-turn Q&A, MCP integration in local dev tools | Consistent, relevant answers across curated test prompts |
| H2 MVP | Multi-domain + context enrichment | Additional domain onboarded, light conversation context, improved KB ingestion pipeline | 2nd domain operational with comparable quality metrics |
| H3 Platform | Scale + governance | Unified multi-domain management, observability, access policies, continuous content updates | Stable operations across domains with monitoring & quality gates |
| H4 Ecosystem | Extensibility & advanced experience | Multi-channel (web, internal portals), escalation pathways, advanced analytics | External embedding & partner adoption |

## 8. Prototype (H1) Scope
In-scope (Must):
- Single domain (AMG) focused knowledge base (curated sample content acceptable).
- Single-turn Q&A: user input → orchestrated response.
- Deterministic MCP tool surfaces (KB search / orchestrator status) for transparency.
- Basic evaluation via manually defined prompt set.

Deferred (Conscious deferrals; document in `tradeoffs.md` where applicable):
- Multi-turn conversational memory.
- Full content coverage of AMG official documentation.
- Performance optimization / scaling topology.
- Advanced telemetry, analytics, and governance controls.
- Multi-channel deployment (web embed, voice, mobile).

Out of Scope (Prototype will not attempt):
- Human escalation workflows.
- Compliance-grade security features.
- Automated content freshness pipelines.
- Autonomous multi-agent planning chains.

## 9. Functional Capabilities (Prototype Definition)
Core functional pillars (kept high-level):
1. Domain Query Handling – Accept natural language questions about AMG.
2. Domain Grounding – Use constrained knowledge base to inform responses.
3. Response Synthesis – Produce concise, relevant, scoped answers (avoid hallucinated breadth).
4. Tool Transparency – Expose status/diagnostics for operator trust (e.g., orchestrator status tool).
5. Extensibility Baseline – Knowledge base and orchestration pathways structured for domain substitution.

## 10. Principles (Applied from Constitution)
- Spec-first: Each new capability backed by spec or tradeoff entry before substantial implementation.
- Deliberate Simplicity: Avoid preemptive abstractions (e.g., multi-domain registry logic) until Horizon trigger.
- Traceability: All durable docs logged in `memory.md`; decisions recorded in `tradeoffs.md` when non-obvious.
- Test Where It Matters: Unit tests around core logic; integration tests across MCP surfaces.

## 11. Success Metrics (Directional for Prototype)
We do NOT instrument full analytics in H1 but we define qualitative/structured evaluation axes:
- Relevance: % of evaluation prompts judged “acceptably accurate” by reviewer.
- Clarity: Responses within target length (concise—no rambling) and free of contradictory statements.
- Domain Groundedness: References or implied context map to curated KB content (spot-checked).
- Repeatability: Same prompt yields stable class of answer (expected minor variation in wording only).
- Expansion Readiness: Effort estimate to onboard second domain ≤ predefined threshold (qualitative).

Future (H2+): add quantitative coverage %, drift detection, user satisfaction proxy, content freshness metrics.

## 12. Key Assumptions (Reference Only)
See `assumptions.md` for the full list. Primary assumptions leveraged here:
- Hypothesis already validated (exercise constraint).
- Sufficient sample AMG content exists to meaningfully evaluate domain specificity.
- Single-turn interaction is adequate to validate perceived value.

## 13. Risks (Prototype Lens)
| Risk | Type | Mitigation (Prototype) | Horizon Escalation |
|------|------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Insufficient KB depth weakens perceived value | Product | Curate representative slices (features, pricing, positioning) | H2: Expand ingestion strategy |
| Hallucination / generic filler answers | Quality | Constrain prompting + review test set manually | H2: Add automated eval harness |
| Over-engineering early | Execution | Constitution simplicity principle; peer/AI review gate | H2+: Justify abstractions via tradeoffs |
| Difficulty adding 2nd domain | Strategic | Keep domain-specific content isolated; abstract only when 2nd domain planned | H2: Template extraction |

## 14. Tradeoffs (Pointers)
Documented in `tradeoffs.md` (integration environment, KB simplicity, orchestrator embedding, etc.). This document does not restate them—use the canonical log.

## 15. Evolution Triggers (When to Advance to Next Horizon)
- Advance to H2 when: (a) prototype functional goals met, AND (b) internal review deems >70% prompt relevance, AND (c) second domain candidate identified.
- Advance to H3 when: multi-domain in use + need for governance/observability confirmed.

## 16. Governance Alignment
This document supplies “WHY & WHAT (high-level)” for the product. “HOW” details (architecture, specific technology choices, component responsibilities) intentionally deferred to `architecture-technologies.md`. Any divergence from Constitution principles requires a tradeoff entry + potential amendment pathway if systemic.

## 17. Contact & Ownership
Single-owner model (prototype phase):
- Product / Technical / Delivery: Cesar De la Torre (consolidated role for exercise).

## 18. Status & Version
**Current Horizon**: H1 Prototype (active)
**Document Version**: 1.1  
**Last Updated**: September 2025  
**Status**: Vision defined; prototype implemented; consolidation for horizon advancement readiness.

Intentional minimalism on implementation detail avoids duplication and prevents drift with `architecture-technologies.md`.
