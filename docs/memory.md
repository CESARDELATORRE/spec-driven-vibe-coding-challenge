## üîß Development Guidelines

### `/.github/copilot-instructions.md`
**Purpose**: Global instructions for GitHub Copilot behavior and project rules
**Details**: Defines key must-follow items, memory management, Context7 usage, and commit protocols

### `/.github/instructions/csharp.instructions.md`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive C# and .NET development instructions and coding rules
**Details**: Defines code style, project structure, naming conventions, testing framework guidelines, documentation requirements, and MCP-specific implementation patterns

### `/.github/instructions/tests.instructions.md`
**Purpose**: Testing guidelines and rules for the project
**Details**: Defines rules for creating and running unit tests, UI tests, and maintaining test quality

### `/.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Purpose**: GitHub Actions continuous integration workflow
**Details**: Automated CI/CD pipeline that runs on push/PR to main, dev, and features/* branches. Executes unit tests and code quality checks. Uses .NET 9.0. Integration tests and smoke tests excluded for faster CI runs

### `/.github/workflows/README.md`
**Purpose**: Documentation for GitHub Actions workflows
**Details**: Comprehensive guide explaining CI workflow jobs, test execution order, artifacts, environment variables, security considerations, and monitoring capabilities

### `/AGENTS.md`
**Purpose**: Repository map and development guidelines for agents and workflow
**Details**: Defines style, architecture constraints, PR rules, and contact information

### `/README.md`
**Purpose**: Main project readme file
**Details**: Entry point documentation for the repository

### `/setup/`
**Purpose**: Setup documentation directory
**Details**: Contains instructions for setting up the repository in VS Code and configuring MCP servers

### `/dev.env.example`
**Purpose**: Template of environment variables for local development
**Details**: Non-secret example values for Azure OpenAI and orchestrator flags; users copy to `dev.env` (ignored) to load variables easily. Note: Currently, only the Orchestrator Agent project uses environment variables; the KB MCP Server does not require any environment configuration in the prototype implementation

## üíª Getting started Documentation

### `/src/orchestrator-agent/README.md`
**Purpose**: Usage and integration guide for the Orchestrator MCP Server
**Details**: Documents tools (`get_orchestrator_status`, `ask_domain_question`), configuration via environment variables & appsettings, GitHub Copilot MCP client setup snippet, example prompts, troubleshooting, and security notes. Added post Step 11 for discoverability and onboarding

**Purpose**: Forward-looking architecture & roadmap for evolving from single-step Q&A to a multi-agent orchestration layer
**Details**: Compares Thin vs SK-Embedded vs Hybrid orchestrator patterns, defines staged migration plan, data contract evolution (steps, provenance), security & failure strategy, decision drivers, and actionable near-term steps (interfaces + extraction of Chat Agent). Serves as a living guide for incremental, low-risk scaling

## üìä Journey Documentation

### `/docs-journey-log/Reasoning-Journal-Log.md`
**Purpose**: Complete reasoning and decision-making log throughout the project development

**Details**: Holds ad-hoc draft journals, research prompt experiments, and transient planning notes migrated from former `/docs/temp-word-docs/` (directory relocated for better alignment with journey log artifacts). Treated as non-authoritative scratch sources; canonical distilled content is moved into Markdown specs/architecture docs when stabilized

## üóëÔ∏è Removed Files

### (Removed) `/run-orchestrator.sh`
**Status**: Removed
**Reason**: Simplified workflow now relies on direct `dotnet run` and MCP client auto-launch; script created duplicate execution path and added maintenance overhead

### (Removed) `/.vscode/tasks.json`
**Status**: Removed
**Reason**: Project standardized on direct terminal execution with `dev.env` rather than VS Code-specific configurations. Build commands are documented in AGENTS.md for portability across different IDEs

### (Removed) `/.vscode/launch.local.example.json`
**Status**: Removed
**Reason**: Debug launch indirection replaced by explicit terminal instructions using `dev.env` for portability across editors and CI
