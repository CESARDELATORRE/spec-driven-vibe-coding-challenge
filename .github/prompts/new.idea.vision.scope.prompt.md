description: 'Create a new project idea and vison & scope document'

I want to define all the details for a "Agentic workflow solution accelerator" project. My initial basic idea or north star document with goals and potential approaches is attached in the prompt I sent you.

Analyze deeply and take into account all the documents attached as context for the prompt.

Let's join forces to make this idea into a simple, yet impactful proposal.

FIRST:
- Clarify any areas of my "north star" definition that may need more details
- Suggest new requirements based on the functionality provided
- Consider edge cases that may not be included in my original "north star".
- Organize requirements logically, and break them down into units that would make sense as user stories and related features.
- Raise any important high-level technical considerations, like platforms, languages, frameworks, and overall architecture details.

NEXT:
- Iterate with me until I tell you I am satisfied.

FINALLY:
- Once I tell you I am ready, create a detailed idea and vision scope document (or update an existing file if it exists) in #file:../../docs/03-idea-vision-scope.md following the following structure, as a Markdown file:

```
## Executive Summary

## Context: Customer and old solution situation
### Current chat bot functionality summary
### Problem to be solved (feedback and pain points)
### Main hypothesis
### Hypothesis validation/invalidation

## Product Overview
### Core value proposition:
#### Why this solution is the right next step
### Target audience:

## Business Model
### Key differentiators:
### Potential business model:

## Marketing Plan
### Target audience:
### Strategy:
### Channels:

## Initial Functional Requirements

## Functional Specifications
### Critical Requirements

## Vision: Global long term vision

## Scope: Prototype/POC Scope
### Prototype/POC Selection Criteria:
### Prototype/POC Planning:
### Open to growth criteria. From prototype/POC to MVP:
### Out of Scope for Prototype/POC:
### Tradeoffs in prototype:

## Risk Assessment
### Technical Risks
### Business Risks

## Contact Information
## Document Control
```

The 'Architecture and technical Specifications' (such as architecture for new Agent at a high level, including language, frameworks, and platforms) should not be defined in this 03-idea-vision-scope.md, but in a separate file, and should be generated by a different prompt, not this one.
So be generic from a technology point of view in this document focusing on the functional idea and requirements.

When you are done, output to #file:../../docs/03-idea-vision-scope.md.
