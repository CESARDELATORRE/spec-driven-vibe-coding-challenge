description: 'Create specs doc for a feature: Chat Agent'
---

Your goal is to generate a functional spec for implementing a feature based on the provided "in-line" idea below:

<idea>
Generate a feature specs document covering the following capabilities:

- Prototype/POC scope A very basic Chat Agent to be able to:
  - Understand and process user queries
  - Access and retrieve information from a predefined knowledge base (connected to a KM MCP server)

- Future versions, out of scope, but kept as potential backlog items:
  - Provide accurate and relevant responses based on the knowledge base
  - Handle multi-turn conversations, maintaining context throughout the interaction
  - Learn from user interactions to improve future responses
  
</idea>

Before generating the spec plan, be sure to review the #file:../../docs/03-idea-vision-scope.md file to understand an overview of the project.

RULES:
- Start by defining the user journey steps as simple as possible
- Number functional requirements sequentially
- Include acceptance criteria for each functional requirement
- Use clear, concise language
- Aim to keep user journey as few steps as possible to accomplish tasks
- Keep the functionality and user experience simple and easy to digest
- Do not include detailed implementation details or technical specifications in the plan
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Focus on core functionality first, avoid edge cases unless critical
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Prioritize features that demonstrate the main value proposition
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Use simple, straightforward language to describe features and requirements
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Avoid complex workflows or interactions that may complicate the user experience
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Ensure the plan is easy to understand and implement
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Focus on features that can be realistically implemented within the constraints of a prototype or POC
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Avoid over-engineering or adding unnecessary complexity to the specs
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Keep the feature's specs doc short and to the point, focusing on the most important aspects of the feature, no more than 2 or maximum 3 pages long. 

NEXT:

- Ask me for feedback to make sure I'm happy
- Give me additional things to consider I may not be thinking about

FINALLY:

When satisfied:

- Output your plan in #folder:../../docs/specs/feature-specs-chat-agent.md
- DO NOT start writing any code or implementation plans. Follow instructions.
