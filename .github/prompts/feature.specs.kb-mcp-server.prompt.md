description: 'Create specs doc for a feature: MCP Server for Knowledge Base (KB) access by AI agents'
---

Your goal is to generate a functional spec for implementing a feature based on the provided "in-line" idea below:

<idea>
Generate a feature specs document covering the following capabilities:

- MCP Server that provides access to content from a knowledge base (KB) for use by AI agents.
- The KB for the prototype should simply be a single local text file accesible from the MCP server process.
- The MCP server should be built in a way that abstracts the KB data source, so that in the future it can be extended to support other types of KBs (e.g., large datalake, databases, external APIs, etc.).
- The first version of the MCP server should be implemented following the simplest approach in MCP communication protocol, hence STDIO, however it should be designed with future evolution in mind towards HTTP and Docker deployment (not in the first implementation version, though).
- The MCP server should be able to handle basic requests from AI agents to retrieve content from the KB, such as searching for specific keywords or retrieving entire sections of the text file.
- Basically, it should work as a very much simplified version of the Perplexity MCP server or the Context7 MCP server or, but instead of large data sources and vector DBs as the KB, it should use a simple local text file as the KB.
- Reduce the number of MCP methods/tools to the minimum required to demonstrate the core functionality of the MCP server, while still having basic search and retrieval operations enabling a Chat Agent who will consume this MCP server to answer questions based on this KB.

Before generating the spec plan, be sure to review the #file:../../docs/03-idea-vision-scope.md file to understand an overview of the project.

RULES:
- Start by defining the user journey steps as simple as possible
- Number functional requirements sequentially
- Include acceptance criteria for each functional requirement
- Use clear, concise language
- Aim to keep user journey as few steps as possible to accomplish tasks
- Keep the functionality and user experience simple and easy to digest
- Do not include detailed implementation details or technical specifications in the plan
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Focus on core functionality first, avoid edge cases unless critical
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Prioritize features that demonstrate the main value proposition
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Use simple, straightforward language to describe features and requirements
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Avoid complex workflows or interactions that may complicate the user experience
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Ensure the plan is easy to understand and implement
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Focus on features that can be realistically implemented within the constraints of a prototype or POC
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Avoid over-engineering or adding unnecessary complexity to the specs
- (Special rule for prototype/POC) Keep the feture's specs doc short and to the point, focusing on the most important aspects of the feature, no more than 2 or maximum 3 pages long. 

NEXT:

- Ask me for feedback to make sure I'm happy
- Give me additional things to consider I may not be thinking about

FINALLY:

When satisfied:

- Output your plan in #folder:../../docs/specs/feature-specs-kb-mcp-server.md
- DO NOT start writing any code or implementation plans. Follow instructions.
